This widget gives to the user who inputs his MyAnimeList.net nickname a list of recommended anime to watch considering the anime he already watched.

== Description ==

This widget lets you embed aNi-N-gin anime recommendation system inside your WordPress blog. All the user has to do is inputting his MyAnimeList nickname in the widget.

It uses the remote server of FoOlRulez.org to gather the necessary data, so it uses no power on your own server. All the gathered data comes from MyAnimeList.
